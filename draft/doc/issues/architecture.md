When Client requests to Domain Service save the Domain Entity model, then Client expects the updated Domain Entity model in response from Domain Service.
Client can be e.g. a Storefront Service or an ImEx Service.
Domain Service can be e.g. Player Service, with a Player as an Entity. 

Player model is composite and can contain the Attributes.

Should Player model contain the Attributes in response?
Should Domain Entity model contain the SubEntity models in response?
